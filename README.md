# Algorithms

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing.

## Documentation

Each algorithm directory consists of it's own `README.md`. Which thoroughly explains how the algorithm works, it's common use cases and on how to build, test and run the algorithm. This documentation is also available on [GitHub Pages][pages].

### Code Documentation

You can find the most of code documentation in header files `.hh`. If you don't understand something you can ask a question in [discussions](https://github.com/hammadmajid/algorithms/discussions).

## Setup Guide

<!-- Use Docker, see issue #39 -->

Install **pre-requisites**

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

1. You can [download](pages) or clone the repository using Git
```bash
$ git https://github.com/hammadmajid/algorithms algorithms
```
2. Change working directory
```bash
$ cd algorithms
# Change working directory to the algorithm you want to compile, test or run.
$ cd [algorithm-name]
```
3. Compile algroithm
```bash
$ make compile # in the algorithm directory you want to compile
```
4. Test your changes
```bash
$ compile test # in the algorithm directory you want to test
```
5. Run the algrotihm
```bash
$ make run
```

## Join us in discussions
