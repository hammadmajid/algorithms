1. [Download][download_link] or clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hammadmajid/greedy-algorithm
```
2. Change working directory in terminal
```bash
cd algorithms
```
3. Build all algorithms (optional)
```bash
make # or make all
```
4. Run algorithm

    1. Change working directory to the algorithm you want to run
    
    ```bash
    cd [algorithm-name] # cd ford-fulkerson-algorithm
    ```
    2. Build the algorithm
    
    ```bash
    make compile
